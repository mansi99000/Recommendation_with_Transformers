# Recommendation_with_Transformers
A Fundamental Exploration of Transformers in Personalized Movie Recommendations

I wnated to take the core principles of the transformer and apply them to generate personalized recommendations using user ids and movie sequences from the MovieLens dataset. I have made an attempt to use the Transformer model, known for its effectiveness in NLP, to create a personalized movie recommendation system. Iâ€™ve gone through from data preprocessing to prediction step using the MovieLens dataset. 

This project also demonstrates how the Transformer architecture can adapt to recommendation systems.

MovieLens 1M movie ratings. Stable benchmark dataset. 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies.

Files:
ratings.dat = UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp
users.dat = UserID::Gender::Age::Occupation::Zip-code
movies.dat = MovieID::Title::Genres
